# 2022
This is a test to see if I can get gradle to work correctly at two levels like Fabricate does.

## To use this project from a Mac, GitBash or Linux;
- git clone https://github.com/adligo/2022.git

Then you will need to upload a ssh key to github
Then download the other sub projects;
- cd 2022
- ./gitsub.sh

Finally build it with Java (I'm on 11) and Gradle (I'm on 7.3.3)
./build.sh
